<h1>➦Difference between Variable,Let and Constant:-</h1>
<h2>▶Variable:-</h2>
<p>1.var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped.<br>
2.The scope of a JavaScript variable declared with var is its current execution context.<br>
3.Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
 </p>

<h2>▶Let:-</h2>
<p>1.The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope.<br>
    2.The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.
3.Just like const the let does not create properties of the window object when declared globally.
</p>


<h2>▶Constant:-</h2>
<p>1.Const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned.<br>
    2. However, variables created by the const keyword are immutable.<br>
    3.In other words, you can't reassign them to different values. <br>
    4.Trying to reassign a constant variable will result in a TypeError
