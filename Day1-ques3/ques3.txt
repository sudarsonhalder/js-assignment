Brief into on datatypes in javascript:-
Data types in JavaScript describe the different types or kinds of data that you will be working with and storing in variables.
Otherwise data can get stored in an improper format which will result in issues in your code later on. 

FIVE DATA TYPES ARE:-
1.String
2.Number
3.Boolean
4.Object
5.Arrays 


➤String:-
1.The String object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps Javascript's string primitive data type with a number of helper methods.
2.As JavaScript automatically converts between string primitives and String objects, you can call any of the helper methods of the String object on a string primitive.
3.Strings can be enclosed within either single quotes, double quotes or backticks:

➤Number:-
1.A number data type can be an integer, a floating point value, an exponential value, a ‘NaN’ or a ‘Infinity’.
2.Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc.

➤Boolean:-
1.JavaScript Boolean data type can store one of two values, true or false.
2.Boolean objects can be created using new keyword. e.g. var YES = new Boolean(true);

➤Object:-
1.Object is a non-primitive data type in JavaScript. 
2.It is like any other variable, the only difference is that an object holds multiple values in terms of properties and methods.

➤Arrays:-
1.An array is a special type of variable, which can store multiple values using special syntax.
2.Every value is associated with numeric index starting with 0. The following figure illustrates how an array stores values.
